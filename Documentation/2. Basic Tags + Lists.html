    <!-- First Paragraph -->
    <p>When I first brought my cat home from the <strong>humane society</strong> she was a mangy, pitiful animal. It cost a lot to adopt her: forty dollars. And then I had to buy litter, a litterbox, food, and dishes for her to eat out of. Two days after she came home with me she got taken to the pound by the animal warden. There's a leash law for cats in <em>Fort Collins</em>.</p>

    <!-- Second Paragraph -->
    <p>If they're not in your yard they have to be on a leash. Anyway, my cat is my best friend. I'm glad I got her. She sleeps under the covers with me when it's cold. Sometimes she meows a lot in the middle of the night and wakes me up, though. (unfocused)</p>
